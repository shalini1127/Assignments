1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

The boolean data type is either True or False. In Python, boolean variables are defined by the True and False keywords.
"""

type(b)

"""2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?**bold text**

AND,OR,NOT
"""



"""3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

True and True is True
True and False is False
False and True is False
False and False is False
True or True is True
True or False is True
False or True is True
not True is False
not False is True
AND
A B Output
1 1 1
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
OR
A B Output
1 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 1
0 0 0
NOT
A Output
1 0
0 1

(5 &gt; 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 &gt; 4)

< , <= ,>,>=,== !=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.

= is used for assigning values to a variable while == is used to comapre two values

Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

"""9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

ctrl + c

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

Break statement will end up in the innermost loop if it is used within a nested loop. While using the continue statement the loops do not terminate but continuously go on with the next iteration.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

importing spam?
